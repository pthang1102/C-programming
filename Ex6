/*
Write a function that performs Caesar cipher on the given string.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
The function takes two parameters: the string to be encrypted and an integer indicating the amount of shift. 
Assume that only letters A-Z and whitespace characters are used. White space characters must not be affected by the encryption.
Write a program that uses the function above to create encrypt and decrypt a given text. 
The program must ask user to enter the amount of shift and the text to encrypt. 
The program converts the string to uppercase before using the encryption function. 
When user has entered the values the program prints the original text, the encrypted text and the decrypted text. 
If the program works correctly the original text and decrypted text are identical.
Note: You can encrypt and decrypt with the same function by giving a different shift value as a parameter. 
For example if you encrypted text with shift 7 you decrypt by using shift -7 or (26 - 7) = 19.

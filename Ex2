/*
Write a program that defines a floating-point array of 12 elements. Ask user to enter yearly gross income. 
Then the program assigns values to the array so that elements 0-5 and 7-11 are assigned value that you get 
by diving gross income with 12.5.
Element 6 is assigned value that you get from gross/12.5 * 1.5
Then print the array in the following format:
element[ 0] = 993.0098
element[ 1] = 993.0098
...
element[ 6] = 1489.5147
...
element[11] = 993.0098
total = 12475.1225
You need to get familiar with printf field width specifiers to complete this!
Note that equal signs and decimal points must be aligned as shown above!

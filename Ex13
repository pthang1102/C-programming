/*
Write a program that reads strings and writes them to a file. The string must be dynamically allocated and the string can be of arbitrary length. When the string has been read it is written to the file. The length of the string must be written first then a colon (‘:’) and then the string. The program stops when user enters a single dot (‘.’) on the line.
For example:
User enters: This is a test
Program writes to file: 14:This is a test
Hint: fgets() writes a line feed at the end of the string if it fits in the string. 
Start with a small length, for example 16 characters, if you don’t see a line feed at the end 
then realloc the string to add more space and keep on adding new data to the string until you see a line feed at the end. 
Then you know that you have read the whole line. T
hen remove any ‘\r’ or ‘\n’ from the string and write the string length and the string to the file. 
Free the string before asking for a new string.

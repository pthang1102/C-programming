/*
Write a program that defines a structure to price information. The structure must contain name and price of the item. 
Program must define an array of structures and an integer to hold the count of items. 
The size of the array must be at least 20 elements and program must keep track of the actual count 
and ensure that array bound are not violated.

The program reads the information from a file. The name of the file is asked from the user.
Each item is stored on a single line. The price comes first and is separated from the name with a semicolon. 

For example:
9.99;USB mouse
19.98;SSD 128GB
589.90;MSI GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER VENTUS OC
59.90;HyperX Alloy Core RGB

The program must check that both price and name are successfully read to accept the item in the list. 
When the end of file is reached the program prints count of items and the items in formatted columns as shown below 
(Note alignment of headings and data!):
Name                                        Price
USB mouse                                   9.99
SSD 128GB                                   19.98
MSI GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER VENTUS OC        589.90
HyperX Alloy Core RGB                       59.90

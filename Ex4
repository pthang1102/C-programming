/*
Write a program that asks user to enter current time in 24 hour format and asks how long you want to sleep. 
Program then calculates your wake up time and prints it. 
The program must check that values are entered in correct format and must print an error message if invalid input is entered. 
Program must also check that the entered numbers are in valid range (0 - 23 / 0 - 59).

Example:
Enter current time (hh:mm): 21:56
How long do you want to sleep (h:mm): 8:30
If you go to bed now you must wake up at 6:26.

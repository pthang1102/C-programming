/*
Write a program that reads numbers from a text file and print the average of the number read. 
The first row of the file contains count of numbers to read from the file (excluding the first row). 
For example, if the first row reads 5 then you must read five numbers after the first row and calculate their average.

For example if the file contains:
6
12
13.5
15
16.98
2
4
Your program must print:
Average of 6 numbers is: 10.58

Your program must always check the result of read operation and print an error message if read fails. 
For example if the count indicates that four numbers should follow but reading fails before all numbers are read 
then the program must print an error message that tells that all reading failed and tell how many numbers should have been read 
and how many were actually read. The program must still print the average value of numbers that were read.

For example:
Error! Tried to read 6 numbers, 3 numbers were read.
Average of 3 numbers is: 3.47

/*
Write a function that takes an array of integers and array size as a parameter and returns a float. 
The function calculates average value of the array and returns it.
Write a program that uses an array to hold course grades. The array is initialized to zero in the beginning. 
The program asks user how many students are to be graded. Program must not allow values that are greater that the array size.
Then the program asks user to enter a grade for each student.
Only values in the range 0-5 are accepted. Student number that is displayed to the user is array index + 45000.

(For example if array index is 2 user is asked to enter grade for student nr: 45002)
Program must check that array bounds are not violated!
In the end program calculates the average of course grades using the average function and prints the average with two decimal accuracy.
Remember to write both function declaration and definition!

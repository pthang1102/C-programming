/*
Write a program which multiplies a 3 element vector (3 by 1 matrix) with 3 by 3 matrix.
Program asks user to enter initial values for vector and matrix.
Write a function to do matrix multiplication. Function takes three parameters: Result vector, source vector, source matrix. 
Function returns no value but modifies result vector. Function may not modify source values.
Program must print the initial values before multiplication and result after multiplication.
The matrix multiplication function must do only the multiplication and may not print anything.
